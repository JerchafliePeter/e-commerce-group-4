    <p>
        <center>PeerMe is an online self-education platform that provides advantages to both the company and the users who utilize our unique take on gamified crowdsourced grading. PeerMe’s model is built upon inspiring users to compete for digital rewards, achievements,
            and leaderboard positions. These motivating factors in conjunction with our gamified grading system provide a fun and competitive way to learn something new. PeerMe’s strengths are in its gamified grading system and its enhancement of the
            learning process. Therefore, our customer base will primarily be comprised of individuals who have an interest in self-education - but need a competitive or gamified environment as incentive - as well as traditional teachers and professors
            who are looking for exciting alternatives for assignments.
